**Note: Bitbuilder is still in development, this document may contain dead
links. There is no published documentation for the project yet.** 

There were no good options for using LLVM on the JVM. Bitbuilder is a modern
library for interacting with LLVM's C API, written in idiomatic Kotlin.

Bitbuilder uses [javacpp-presets/llvm][llvm-presets] via JNI to access the
LLVM-C APIs.

## Getting Started

### Project Layout

Bitbuilder is built with Gradle and it makes use of multi-project builds.
This is an overview of the project layout and its important directories

- [bitbuilder-llvm](bitbuilder-llvm): Raw LLVM Bindings for Kotlin
- [bitbuilder](bitbuilder): Bitbuilder Core, Kotlin DSLs and QOL utils
- [samples](samples): Sample projects using the library

This is a guide to installing Bitbuilder. Bitbuilder is available through
Jitpack.

### Prerequisites

Bitbuilder runs on the JVM, so a Java 8+ installation must be present on the
user's machine.

We will be fetching the artifacts from Jitpack so Gradle, or another build
tool of your choice is necessary as well.

You do not have to have a LLVM installation on your machine. The 
[javacpp-presets][llvm-presets] come with prebuilt binaries. If you do not
want to use these binaries, there is an instruction for using self-compiled
binaries in the [documentation](https://vexelabs.io/projects/bitbuilder).

### Installation

This example will use Gradle as its build system, but the process is similar
for other build systems as well.

1. Add the Jitpack repository

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven("https://jitpack.io")
}
```

2. Add the Bitbuilder dependency

Because Bitbuilder does not have a public release yet, the only available
version is the current SNAPSHOT build.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.vexelabs:bitbuilder:master-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

## Usage

Because we are yet to release an initial release of Bitbuilder we do not plan
on offering support for the project for now. A lot of the APIs in the project
are subject to change.

You may find sample projects in the [samples](samples) folder. The Kotlin
autogenerated documentation can be found at [autodoc.vexelabs.io][autodoc-url].

## Roadmap

This is a long-term list of goals we are working towards.

- Kotlin/Native Support
- LLVM Link Time Optimization APIs
