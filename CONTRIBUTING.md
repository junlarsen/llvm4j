# Contributing

If you are interested in contributing to Vexe's development feel free to go through the existing list of issues. 

Discord is our primary form for communication outside of GitHub.

We have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which we expect you to follow.

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure files which are not supposed to be commited are removed. (eg .env, build/)
1. If your code performs any breaking changes, update tests

It is up to the maintainers to decide whether a feature/pull request is necessary.

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team by email 
[me at supergrecko dot dev](mailto:me@supergrecko.dev). All complaints will be 
reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary
and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain 
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of 
specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
